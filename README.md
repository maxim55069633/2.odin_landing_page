# odin-landing_page
"Slay the Spire" is one of my favorite STEAM games. This project is a landing page to call on people to download the game. I apply the CSS knowledge I have learned, especially flex box into it. The design pattern comes from the Odin Project ![the Odin Project webpage design template](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png)

Disclaimer: 
This project is just created to showcase for what I have learned on the Odin Project. It has nothing to do with the official "Slay the Spire" platform.
